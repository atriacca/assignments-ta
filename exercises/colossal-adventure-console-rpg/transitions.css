.box { 
    width: 300px; 
    height: 300px; 
    background-color: blue; 
    margin: auto; 
    border: 1px solid #333;
    box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0 #999;    border-radius: 10%; 
    transition-property: all;
    transition-duration: 1s;
} 
.box:hover { 
    background-color: lightblue; 
    box-shadow: none; 
    border-radius: 0; 
}

1) Which of these are valid CSS transitions:
transition-property
transition-duration
transition-opacity
transition-timing-function
transition-width
transition-delay

That is correct! There are four CSS transitions properties: transition-property,
transition-duration, transition-timing-function and 
transition-delay.

2) T/F: It is possible to CSS properties transition with different duration times.

That is correct! Individual CSS properties can have their own timing for both duration and delay. The syntax is:

.box:hover {
    transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];
}


T/F: It is possible to CSS properties transition with different duration times.

That is correct! Individual CSS properties can have their own timing for both duration and delay.
