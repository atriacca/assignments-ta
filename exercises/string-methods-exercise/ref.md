String Methods Exercise  28 JANUARY 2019

Make a function that will return any given string into all caps followed by the same string all lowercase.

capilizeAndLowercase("Hello") // => "HELLOhello"
Make a function that returns a number half the length, and rounded down. You'll need to use Math.floor().

findMiddleIndex("Hello") // => 2
findMiddleIndex("Hello World") // => 5
Make a function that uses slice() and the other functions you've written to return the first half of the string

returnFirstHalf("Hello") // => "He"
returnFirstHalf("Hello World") // => "Hello"
Make a function that takes a string and returns that string where the first half is capitalized, and the second half is lower cased. (If the string length is odd, capitalize the shorter of the first half.)

capilizeAndLowercase("Hello") // => "HEllo"
capilizeAndLowercase("Hello World") // => "HELLO world"
Optional Code Challenge (This one is a step up in difficulty):

Make a function that takes any string and capitalizes any character that follows a space.

capitalize("hey friends! practice practice practice!") // -> "Hey Friends! Practice Practice Practice!"
